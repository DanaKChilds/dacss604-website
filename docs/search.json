    "text": "Column\n\nHow to Read This Chart\nThis chart compares monthly Average Order Value (AOV) for loyalty members and non-members from 2019–2022. Non-member AOV surges in 2020, then declines through 2021–2022, while member AOV is steadier. There are clear inversion windows (mid-2021 to early-2022, including Jul/Dec-2021 and Jan-2022) where member AOV meets or exceeds non-member AOV.\nTaken together with the order-volume patterns, this matches the project narrative: the loyalty program concentrates volume (many months where member orders meet or beat non-members) but trails on long-run AOV overall, with specific months where members out-spend non-members on a per-order basis.\n\n\nRecommendations\nBased on these AOV and loyalty patterns, the project recommends:\n\nShift more loyalty activity into Q4. Q4 demand is the biggest seasonal spike and members match or exceed non-members on orders in peak months. Move more loyalty promos, points boosts, and reminders into Oct–Dec and track lift in member order share and the AOV gap during Q4.\nUse inversion months to close the AOV gap. Member AOV trails in the long run ($240 vs $275), but there are clear inversion months (e.g., Jul/Dec-2021, Jan-2022) when member AOV ≥ non-member. Close the gap with member-only bundles that mirror known patterns: anchor with 27\" 4K monitors, webcams, AirPods, and MacBooks where appropriate, aiming for AOV parity.\nMake email the primary loyalty channel. Email is the strongest revenue channel for members, especially in 2020 and 2022. Make email the main vehicle for loyalty offers with a simple cadence (launch → reminder → last-chance), backed by direct/social targeting, and A/B test subject lines, offers, and timing."
