:::{#me}

Collaborative and detail-oriented Data Analyst with a background in project and stakeholder management. Skilled in Python, SQL, and Tableau, translating messy datasets into actionable KPIs and insights. Led projects ranging from a media-cited national legal data analysis to a deployed NBA similarity app, driven to deliver results that inform strategy and improve decision making.

## Goals

In the short term, my goal is to grow as a hands-on data scientist, building end-to-end workflows with SQL, Python or R to support business and policy decisions. Longer term, I want to work in a role where I own data products and collaborate with cross-functional teams, from domain experts to leadership, to make data a routine part of how organizations plan and measure their work.
